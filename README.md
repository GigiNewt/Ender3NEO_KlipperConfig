# Ender3NEO_KlipperConfig

I recommend using the latest version, any outdated version will be labeled so.

lots of improvements to be made (qof updates) but it works perfect as a firmware

i am currently using it in OCTOKLIPPER so if you use this in Mailsail or fluidd you may have to make a few changes but it should run fine


MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MAY NEED TO BE MADE IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK ON YOUR PRINTER
